# Architecture decision records

An [architecture
decision](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/architecture-decision-records)
is a software design choice that evaluates:

-   a functional requirement (features).
-   a non-functional requirement (technologies, methodologies, libraries).

The purpose is to understand the reasons behind the current architecture, so
they can be carried-on or re-visited in the future.
